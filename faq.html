        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: How can I get an update when a new post comes out?</h3>
        <p>A: I post about my new post on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lilianweng" target="_blank">@lilianweng</a>. There is also an <a href="#">RSS</a> feed.</p>

        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: What tool do you use for plotting?</h3>
        <p>A: I'm using Google Presentation (cloud version of PowerPoint).</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: What if I see something incorrect in the post?</h3>
        <p>A: Send me an email: anotherlilian@gmail.com if you have questions or find errors. Thanks! But time of one person is limited and I'm really busy nowadays, so it may take some time for me to get to process it.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: Can I translate your posts to another language?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes and my pleasure! But please email me in advance and please keep the original post link on top (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad).</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: Do you update your old posts?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes, I update my old posts periodically. Every time I would add an one-line update message in blue on top of that post, like: <code>[Updated on 2025-06-01: add new section about...]</code>.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: Hmmm... I have papers on super relevant topics but you didn't include them?</h3>
        <p>A: As you may know, it is pretty challenging to do a comprehensive literature review given a big topic. There are so many papers in the wild. With Google scholar and recursive citation search, I get to see quite a lot of papers but still not all of them. You are more than welcome to shoot me an email with pointers to interesting but missing papers. Cheers!</p>

        <h3 class="faq-question">Q: How can you keep up blogging?</h3>
        <p>A: "Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional" — this is the first sentence of Haruki Murakami's book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running". I love that book. His altitude towards running is pretty much aligned with how I feel about maintaining this blog.</p>
